The information we receive depends on what you do while visiting our site. We will not obtain personally identifying information about you unless you choose to provide it.

This information includes data such as your IP address, the time and date, pages entered, and time spent on individual pages. Your IP address is not linked to anything personally identifiable.</p>

                        <h3 className="mt-4 fs-5">INFORMATION USE:</h3>
                        <p className='section-content'>If you request information from us or wish to access certain features of the site, you will be asked to provide personally identifying information so that we can respond effectively to your requests and needs.

                        <p className='section-content'>Most clients tell us they appreciate receiving our news and promotions; however, we believe it's very important for you to be able to choose whether you receive periodic mailings and information from us. You can choose to opt-out at any time by simply replying to a mailing to inform us of your preference. All of our mailings will clearly explain how you can easily opt-out and stop receiving information from us.</p>

We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of any website before providing personally identifying information.</p>

                        <p className='section-content'>Ni-Val maintains adequate data security measures to protect information against unauthorized access and disclosure.
